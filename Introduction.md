## Introduction to an N-bit Up-Down Asynchronous Counter

This project presents a flexible and scalable design for an **N-bit Up-Down Asynchronous Counter**. This is a fundamental digital logic circuit used to count clock pulses in two directions: incrementing (up) or decrementing (down). The key features of this design are its **asynchronous** nature, where each flip-flop (FF) is triggered by the output of the preceding one, and its scalability to create counters of any desired bit size (N-bit).

**Key Features:**

* **N-bit Design:** The design can be easily adapted to create counters of various sizes (e.g., 4-bit, 8-bit, 16-bit).
* **Asynchronous Operation:** Constructed using JK or T flip-flops, where the clock pulse propagates serially from one flip-flop to the next.
* **Up-Down Control:** A single control input **(UP)** allows the user to switch between counting up when **UP = 1** and counting down when **UP = 0**.
* **Practical Application:** Ideal for simulation and implementation in systems that require a bidirectional counting mechanism.
